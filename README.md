# Web Tempest

## Overview

**Web Tempest** is a powerful web-building tool that allows users to create website layouts by selecting and arranging various components such as buttons, search bars, cards, and text. Using a **drag-and-drop canvas**, users can place elements wherever they like to visualize their website before coding it.

This project captures the position and properties of each element and utilizes this data to generate a structured website layout.

> **Note:** Web Tempest is currently under development, and many features are yet to be implemented.
